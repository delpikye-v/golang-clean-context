Advanced Go (Golang) Expertise

1. Concurrency & Parallelism

Goroutines: Lightweight threads capable of running hundreds of thousands within a single process.

Channel Patterns: Fan-in/Fan-out, Worker Pool, Pipeline.

Context Management: Cancellation propagation, timeouts, deadlines.

Sync vs Atomic: Locks, RWMutex, Once, Cond vs atomic operations.

2. Architecture & Design

Clean / Hexagonal Architecture: Separation of domain, use cases, and infrastructure layers.

Dependency Injection (DI): Using Wire or Fx.

Modularization: Splitting modules by bounded context (DDD).

Generics (Go 1.18+): Implementing generic repositories, services, and collection utilities.

3. Data & Persistence

Database ORM/Drivers: GORM (popular), sqlx (lightweight).

Migrations: golang-migrate.

Advanced DB Patterns: Transaction context, optimistic/pessimistic locking.

Caching: Redis client (go-redis), cache-aside and write-through patterns.

4. Networking & Communication

gRPC: High-performance, contract-first with Protobuf.

gRPC Gateway: Bridging REST ↔ gRPC.

Message Queues: Kafka, SQS, NATS → pub/sub and event sourcing.

Real-time Communication: WebSockets, Server-Sent Events (SSE).

5. Performance & Scaling

Profiling & Tracing: pprof, CPU/memory profiling, goroutine leak detection.

Benchmarking: testing.B (sub-benchmarks, allocations).

GC Tuning: Understanding GOGC, memory pooling with sync.Pool.

Zero-copy I/O: Leveraging io.Reader, io.Writer, bufio.

6. Security & Authentication

JWT & OAuth2: Middleware authentication, refresh token rotation.

mTLS: Mutual TLS for gRPC.

Secret Management: AWS Secrets Manager, Vault.

7. Deployment & Cloud

Dockerization: Multi-stage builds (image size < 20MB).

Serverless: AWS Lambda with Go.

Kubernetes Operator Pattern: Building custom controllers in Go.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI pipelines.

8. Advanced Patterns

Plugin Systems: Using Go plugins or dynamic modules.

Code Generation: go generate, stringer, Protobuf.

Reflection & Unsafe: For advanced dynamic behaviors (ORM, JSON parsers).

Event-driven Workflows: Saga / Orchestration patterns with AWS Step Functions, Temporal.
